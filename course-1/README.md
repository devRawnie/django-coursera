## HTML Documents

- Hyper Text Markup Language
- `<head></head>` contain metadata about the HTML Document
- `<body></body>` contain displayable content on the page
- Special Characters 
  - &lt; &gt; (Less than, greater than)

- `<pre>` tag respects whitespace

## CSS

- Cascading Style Sheet: Closer the rule is to a tag, higher its priority
- General Syntax: `selector {attribute: properties;}`
- Inline > Embedded within page in `<head><style></style></head>` tag > External stylesheet linked with a `<style src="path/to/css">` tag
- `span` and `div` tag don't inherit styling from others, and the only style that they have is the style that we explicitly provide to these tags

## SQL

- Structured Query Language
- Abstracts the data storage mechanism and gives ability to perform CRUD operations
- Test [here](https://sqlitebrowser.org)
